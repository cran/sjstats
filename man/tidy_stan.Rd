\title{Tidy summary output for stan models}
\usage{
tidy_stan(x, prob = 0.89, typical = "median", trans = NULL,
  type = c("fixed", "random", "all"), digits = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{stanreg}, \code{stanfit} or \code{brmsfit} object.}

\item{prob}{Vector of scalars between 0 and 1, indicating the mass within
the credible interval that is to be estimated. See \code{\link{hdi}}.}

\item{typical}{The typical value that will represent the Bayesian point estimate.
By default, the posterior median is returned. See \code{\link[sjmisc]{typical_value}}
for possible values for this argument.}

\item{trans}{Name of a function or character vector naming a function, used
to apply transformations on the estimate and HDI-values. The
values for standard errors are \emph{not} transformed!}

\item{type}{For mixed effects models, specify the type of effects that should
be returned. \code{type = "fixed"} returns fixed effects only,
\code{type = "random"} the random effects and \code{type = "all"} returns
both fixed and random effects.}

\item{digits}{Amount of digits to round numerical values in the output.}
}
\value{
A tidy data frame, summarizing \code{x}, with consistent column names.
        To distinguish multiple HDI values, column names for the HDI get a suffix
        when \code{prob} has more than one element.
}
\description{
Returns a tidy summary output for stan models.
}
\details{
The returned data frame has an additonal class-attribute,
   \code{tidy_stan}, to pass the result to its own \code{print()}-method.
   The \code{print()}-method create a cleaner output, especially for multilevel,
   zero-inflated or multivariate response models, where - for instance -
   the conditional part of a model is printed separately from the zero-inflated
   part, or random and fixed effects are printed separately.
   \cr \cr
   The returned data frame gives information on:
   \itemize{
     \item{The Bayesian point estimate (column \emph{estimate}, which is by
           default the posterior median; other statistics are also possible,
           see argument \code{typical}).}
     \item{
       The standard error (which is actually the \emph{median absolute deviation}).
     }
     \item{
       The HDI (see \code{\link{hdi}}). Computation for HDI is based on the
       code from Kruschke 2015, pp. 727f.
     }
     \item{
       The ratio of effective numbers of samples, \emph{neff_ratio}, (i.e.
       effective number of samples divided by total number of samples).
       This ratio ranges from 0 to 1, and should be close to 1. The closer
       this ratio comes to zero means that the chains may be inefficient,
       but possibly still okay.
     }
     \item{
       The Rhat statistics. When Rhat is above 1, it usually indicates that
       the chain has not yet converged, indicating that the drawn samples
       might not be trustworthy. Drawing more iteration may solve this issue.
     }
     \item{
       The Monte Carlo standard error (see \code{\link{mcse}}). It is defined
       as standard deviation of the chains divided by their effective sample
       size and \dQuote{provides a quantitative suggestion of how big the
       estimation noise is} (\emph{Kruschke 2015, p.187}).
