\title{Check overdispersion of GL(M)M's}
\usage{
overdisp(x, ...)

zero_count(x, tolerance = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted model of class \code{merMod}, \code{glmmTMB}, \code{glm},
or \code{glm.nb} (package \pkg{MASS}).}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}

\item{tolerance}{The tolerance for the ratio of observed and predicted
zeros to considered as over- or underfitting zero-counts. A ratio
between 1 +/- \code{tolerance} is considered as OK, while a ratio
beyond or below this treshold would indicate over- or underfitting.}
}
\value{
For \code{overdisp()}, information on the overdispersion test; for
        \code{zero_count()}, the amount of predicted and observed zeros in
        the outcome, as well as the ratio between these two values.
}
\description{
\code{overdisp()} checks generalized linear (mixed) models for
             overdispersion, while \code{zero_count()} checks whether models
             from Poisson-families are over- or underfitting zero-counts in
             the outcome.
}
\details{
For \code{merMod}- and \code{glmmTMB}-objects, \code{overdisp()} is
         based on the code in the \href{http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html}{GLMM FAQ},
         section \emph{How can I deal with overdispersion in GLMMs?}.
         Note that this function only returns an \emph{approximate} estimate
         of an overdispersion parameter, and is probably inaccurate for
         zero-inflated mixed models (fitted with \code{glmmTMB}).
         \cr \cr
         The same code as above for mixed models is also used to check
         overdispersion for negative binomial models.
         \cr \cr
         For Poisson-models, the overdispersion test is based on the code
         from Gelman and Hill (2007), page 115.
}
\note{
For overdispersoion test, a p-value < .05 indicates overdispersion.
      \cr \cr
      For \code{zero_count()}, a model that is underfitting zero-counts
      indicates a zero-inflation in the data, i.e. it is recommended to
      use negative binomial or zero-inflated models then.

\examples{
library(sjmisc)
data(efc)

# response has many zero-counts, Poisson models
# might be overdispersed
barplot(table(efc$tot_sc_e))

fit <- glm(tot_sc_e ~ neg_c_7 + e42dep + c160age,
           data = efc, family = poisson)
overdisp(fit)
zero_count(fit)

library(lme4)
efc$e15relat <- to_factor(efc$e15relat)
fit <- glmer(tot_sc_e ~ neg_c_7 + e42dep + c160age + (1 | e15relat),
             data = efc, family = poisson)
overdisp(fit)
