Version 0.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* `inequ_trend` to calculate proportional change of absolute and relative inequalities between two status groups for a vector of given prevalence rates.

Changes to functions:
* `bootstrap` is now much more memory efficient due to use of pointers.
* `boot_ci`, `boot_se` and `boot_p` now accept multiple variables as input.
* `resp_val` now also applies to models fitted with `nlme::lme`.

Version 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
* Removed non-necessary checks for package-availability.

New functions:
* `bootstrap` to generate bootstrap replicates of data frames.
* `boot_ci` to compute confidence intervals from bootstrapped values.
* `pred_vars` to get the names of predictor variables from fitted models.
* `resp_var` to get the name of the response variable from fitted models.
* `resp_val` to get the values of the response vector from fitted models.

Version 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* Added functions `weight` and `weight2` to weight vectors.
* Added functions `wtd_sd` and `wtd_se` to compute weighted standard deviations and standard errors.
* Added function `merMod_p` to compute p-values for merMod-objects.

Changes to functions:
* `r2` now supports `plm` objects.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed typo in print-method for `icc`.

Version 0.1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
* Initial release on CRAN.
