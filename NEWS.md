* Reduce package dependencies.

## New functions

* `cred_int()`, to compute uncertainty intervals of Bayesian models. Mimics the behaviour and style of `hdi()` and is thus a convenient complement to functions like `posterior_interval()`.

# sjstats 0.16.0

## General

* Added `print()`-methods for some more functions, for a clearer output.

* `link_inverse()` gets a `multi.resp`-argument, to return a list of link-inverse-functions for multivariate-response models (of class `brmsfit` or `stanmvreg`).

* Effect sizes (`anova_stats()`, `eta_sq()` etc.) are now also computed for mixed models.
* To avoid confusion, `n_eff()` now computes the number of effective samples, and no longer its ratio in relation to the total number of samples.

* Fixed issue in `se()` for `merMod`-objects.
* Fixed issue in `p_value()` for mixed models with KR-approximation, which is now more accurate.
